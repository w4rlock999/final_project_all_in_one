      "  - ✅ **Strength**: 7 years of production-level ML deployments (AWS/Kubernetes) with TensorFlow/PyTorch. Demonstrated 35% latency reduction in NLP systems.  \n",
      "  - ⚠️ **Gap**: No explicit multi-agent RL projects or OpenAI Gym/RLlib implementations in portfolio.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Safety-Critical Systems**:  \n",
      "  - ✅ **Strength**: Pioneered bias testing protocols at Innovate AI Labs (2021–2025), showing foundational safety mindset.  \n",
      "  - ❌ **Missing**: No verifiable jailbreak detection pipelines or adversarial LLM testing per job's \"Failure Profile\" requirements.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Research Portfolio Evaluation (75% Match)\n",
      "- **Publications**:  \n",
      "  - ✅ **Strength**: NeurIPS 2024 workshop participation + ethical AI publications align with Anthropic's research culture.  \n",

      "  ✅ **Full Match**: GitHub portfolio shows Kubernetes-scaling of summarization systems (matching job's \"public code contributions\" requirement).  \n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Cultural Fit (92% Match)\n",
      "- **Mission Alignment**:  \n",

      "\n",
      "- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**:  \n",
      "  ✅ **Strength**: 3+ hackathons and open-source contributions demonstrate team integration capacity.  \n",

      "\n",
      "## 4. Systems Proficiency (80% Match)\n",

      "  ✅ **Strength**: AWS SageMaker + Docker/Kubernetes pipelines at DataSense (2018–2021) exceed basic requirements.  \n",
